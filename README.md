# Intermediate Presentation 2
 The program has input files with preset coordinates that can be changed. The FileIO takes the user input when the program runs in the form of which file they want to use like "Set2_4Points.txt". 
 
 The program will not run for files that contain spaces, the inputted file name is wrong or does not exist, or there are missing points in the file's coordinates.
 
 The program was made with java JDK-14. To run the program, simply run MyCanvas.java and input desired file when told. The program will return a triangulation of the point set in the given file. If highlight and uncomment lines 162-198 once, and repeat previous instructions, the program will output a different triangulation of smaller total edge weight.
 
 There is a project within the .zip file that downloads when you click view raw, but to be sure, all java and point set files have also been uploaded separately.
